# Specs

A service for exposing specifications expressed as Gherkin feature files via a nice web UI.

In the UI specify a https URL for a Git repo, and if that repo contains markdown or feature files they will be displayed. The idea is to make specifications stored in a repo visible and searchable, for people who aren't familiar with version control systems, and as part of a living documentation system.

If you want to run Specs as a service we recommend you use the Docker instructions given below.

We're trying out continuous delivery on this project so in theory the `master` branch is always stable. A demo is available at http://specs.sponte.uk/ , it may take a few seconds to spin up and will not persist data for long.

## Development installation instructions

* Install [node](https://nodejs.org/).
* Clone this repository.
* Move to the cloned project directory and run `npm install`.
* To start the server locally `npm start` -- by default the web UI will be visible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
* Build tasks are defined in [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) so if you want to use them install Gulp globally `npm install --global gulp`. If you would like to see a list of available tasks just type `gulp`. There are some other tasks defined in the package.json which are currently used for CI purposes.


## Installing as a service using npm

To install the latest version from npm
* `npm install -g oss-specs`.
* To start the server `oss-specs`.
* The service should be running and visible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Installing as a service using Docker

* If you haven't already then [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
* On the Docker command line `docker run -Pd specs/specs` to run the container in the background and map ports from the container to the containing VM.
* The service should be running and visible at the IP of the Docker VM on whatever port Docker mapped the to.

Alternatively, get the container image here https://hub.docker.com/r/specs/specs/ and start it in whatever way you prefer.

## Configuration

There are two types of possible configuration:

### App wide configuration through environment variables

* SPECS_OUT_DIR - Specifies location of project-data folder, by default this lives in the root of the project.
* SPECS_ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL - Disables SSL certificate verification when cloning repos.

### Project specific configuration via a specs.json file
The file should be in the root of your repository. The file an be named `specs.json` or `.specs.json` . See the [.specs.json](.specs.json) file in the root of this repository for examples.

Keys:
 * ciLink: A string specifying a link to a CI server with results related to the current specifications. This is a simplistic first pass at linking the specifications to the results. If provided then the link will be visible on project pages. See the [.specs.json](.specs.json) for an example.
 * editUrlFormat: A string in the format of a [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template used for constructing a link that will allow a file of interest to be edited in the UI of the Git server where the project repository is kept.  See the [.specs.json](.specs.json) for an example.
 * projectViews: An object with keys specifying named configurations for creating filtered views into projects.  See the [.specs.json](.specs.json) for an example. Allowed keys are:
   * default - A boolean, if true this view will be used by default in the UI.
   * excludedPaths - An array of folder paths to exclude from the UI on the project page.
   * pathsToHide - Specify beginnings of directory paths to hide on the project page. E.g. if you specified 'src/test/specs' then a directory 'src/test/specs/my_wondeful_feature' would be displayed in the directory list as '... my_wonderful_feature'.
 * ciJobs - An object with keys specifying url links to jobs for different ci servers.
   * jenkinsJobs - A list of urls to locations we wish to check when getting test results

## POST request endpoints

There is a POST request route defined on the deployed app root URL for requesting repos to be checked out or updated, for instance if the app is deployed to myspecs.example.com then the POST route for adding or updating the Specs repo would be `https://myspecs.example.com/?repo_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Foss-specs%2Fspecs.git` .
This can be useful for instance in configuring web-hooks in your Git server so that the information in your Specs deployment is updated whenever someone pushes new information your remote Git repo.
